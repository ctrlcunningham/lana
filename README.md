# lana

a simple client for the gemini api built around the terminal.

## context

i wanted aistudio in the terminal.

## ai usage

since this project is logged in flavourtown, i do need to disclose how i used ai to make this project:

- ai was only used for debugging and as a search engine
- this project itself is merely a client for ai apis
- i did have it suggest what tools i should give it tho

## roadmap

- [x] basic gemini api interface
- [x] conversation
- [x] basic search tool calls
- [x] file manipulation and code execution tools (make these not suck)
- [x] sysprompt encouraging _heavy_ tool usage
- [ ] asyncification
- [ ] switch to selenium
- [ ] code execution in container so she doesn't `rm -rf` anything
- [ ] discord integration because why not
- [ ] tba
