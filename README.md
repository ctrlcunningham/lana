# lana

a simple client for the gemini api built around the terminal.

## context

i wanted aistudio in the terminal.

## ai usage

since this project is logged in flavourtown, i do need to disclose how i used ai to make this project:

- ai was used to help understand docs and in place of a search engine... and recently was used to help me debug some insane gemini api shenanigans but i did replace its solution with my own after fully understanding it
- this project itself is merely a client for ai apis
- i did also have it suggest what tools i should give it tho

## roadmap

- [x] basic gemini api interface
- [x] conversation
- [x] basic search tool calls
- [x] file manipulation and code execution tools (make these not suck)
- [x] sysprompt encouraging _heavy_ tool usage
- [x] asyncification
- [x] switch to selenium
- [ ] multimodal inputs
- [ ] discord integration because why not
- [ ] tbd
