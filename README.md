# lana

a simple client for the gemini api built around the terminal.

## context

i wanted aistudio in the terminal.

## ai usage

since this project is logged in flavourtown, i do need to disclose how i used ai to make this project:

- this project was _not_ vibe-coded
- despite vscode's nagging, i did not touch agent mode
- ai was only used for debugging and as a search engine
- this project itself is merely a client for ai apis
